# Caffeine-UI
Prevents your mac from sleeping. Uses `caffeinate` which apparently is included in all Macs by default

I drew inspiration from [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) which I've used for many years but seems to be abandoned for a while.

I also drew inspiration from [KeepingYouAwake](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake/) which I used to learn a lot of Mac programming.
